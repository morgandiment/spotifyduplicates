# Spotify Playlist Duplicates Finder 

Just a small Python project to find duplicates in public Spotify playlists using their API.

To get started:
- Clone this repo.
- Make a new virtual environment, then activate it.
- Create a file named ```.env``` and see ```.env.example``` for what information it should contain from the Spotify API.
- Then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python duplicate_finder.py
```
It will prompt you for the URL of the playlist, and then output the results.
